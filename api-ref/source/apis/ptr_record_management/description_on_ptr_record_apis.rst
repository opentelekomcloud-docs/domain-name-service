Description on PTR Record APIs
==============================

PTR records are region-level resources, which are isolated and managed based on projects.

Before creating, querying, or unsetting PTR records, specify a project in **X-Project-Id** in the request header to perform the operations. If you do not specify one, the default project of the token will be used.

.. note::

   For details about **X-Project-Id**, see `API Usage Guidelines <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/apiug/apig-en-api-180328001.html?tag=API%20Documents>`__.
