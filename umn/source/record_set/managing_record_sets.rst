Managing Record Sets
====================

**Scenarios**
-------------

You can modify, delete, disable, or enable record sets, and view their details.

Modifying a Record Set
----------------------

Change the TTL, value, and description of a record set to better address your service requirements.

.. note::

   SOA and NS record sets are automatically generated by the system and cannot be deleted.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the service list, choose **Network** > **Domain Name Service**.

   The DNS console is displayed.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Public Zones** or **Private Zones**.

   The zone list is displayed.

#. (Optional) If you have selected **Private Zones**, click |image1| on the upper left corner to select the region and project.

#. Click the zone name.

   The **Record Sets** page is displayed.

#. Locate the record set you want to modify and click **Modify** under **Operation**.

   The **Modify Record Set** dialog box is displayed.

#. Modify the parameters.

   You can change only the TTL, value, and description of a record set.

#. Click **OK**.

Deleting a Record Set
---------------------

.. note::

   SOA and NS record sets are automatically generated by the system and cannot be deleted.

Record sets that are no longer required can be deleted. After a record set is deleted, it will become unavailable. For example, if an A record set is deleted, the domain name cannot be resolved into the IPv4 address specified in the record set. If a CNAME record set is deleted, the domain alias cannot be mapped to the domain name.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the service list, choose **Network** > **Domain Name Service**.

   The DNS console is displayed.

3. On the **Dashboard** page, click **Public Zones** or **Private Zones**.

   The zone list is displayed.

4. (Optional) If you have selected **Private Zones**, click |image2| on the upper left corner to select the region and project.

5. Click the zone name.

   The **Record Sets** page is displayed.

6. Locate the record set you want to delete and click **Delete** under **Operation**.

7. In the **Delete Record Set** dialog box, click **Yes**.
