What Can I Do If There Is Message Indicating that the Public Zone Already Exists?
=================================================================================

If there is a message indicating that the public zone you are creating has been created by another user, send an email to **cloud-products@telekom.de** for identity authentication. After your identity is authenticated, you will receive an email to notify you that you can re-create the zone.

Provide the following information when you send the email:

-  Your domain name
-  Evidence that proves you have registered the domain name, for example, the proof of purchase or the email notifying that the domain name is valid for you
