User Permissions
================

The system provides two types of permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-  User management refers to management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Resource management refers to control operations that can be performed by users on cloud service resources.

The DNS service provides the following resources: public zones, private zones, and PTR records.

-  Public zone: global-level resources. However, you need to add permissions for users in the region, instead of in the global service.
-  Private zone and PTR record: region-level resources. You need to add permissions for users in the project.

For details, see section `Permissions <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html>`__.
