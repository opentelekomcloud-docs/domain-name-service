Project
=======

Projects are used to group and isolate cloud resources, including computing, storage, and network resources. Multiple projects can be created for one account. A project can be a department or a project team.

Public zones are global-level resources, while private zones and PTR records are resources at the region level. Private zones and PTR records are isolated and managed based on projects. You need to create, query, and configure private zones or PTR records in specific regions and projects.
