What Can I Do If the System Prompts that the Domain Name Already Exists When I Create a Public Zone?
====================================================================================================

If the system prompts that the domain name has been created by another user when you create a public zone, send an email to **cloud-products@telekom.de** for identity authentication. After the authentication is approved, the system sends an email to notify you that you can re-create the zone.

Provide the following information in the email:

-  Involved domain name
-  Evidence that proves you have registered the domain name, for example, the proof of purchase or the email notifying that the domain name is valid for you
