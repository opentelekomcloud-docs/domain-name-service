Does DNS Support Wildcard Entries?
==================================

DNS allows you to configure wildcard entries.

A wildcard entry is a record set that uses an asterisk (``*``) as the name and matches requests for any domain name based on the configuration you set. For more information, see RFC 4592.

DNS supports wildcard entries for the following record set types: A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, CAA, and SRV.
